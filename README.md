# Rocket Propellant Calculator
![Screenshot](/testscreen.png?raw=true "Optional Title")
**(Usage example showing space shuttle main engine values)**

A tool to calculate the mass/volume ratios for different fuel and oxidizer combinations in rocket propellant.
6 propellants are preprogrammed or you can select new propellant and enter your own density values.

Instructions:

1. Select fuel and oxidizer or enter your own.
2. Enter either volume or mass ratio value for one of the propellants. The remaining 3 values will be computed automatically.
3. Use the selector to select a calculation type and enter the value for the data you have. 
4. The remaining values will be calculated automatically. 
5. (optionally) Select max thrust and enter total of all relevent engines. Specific impulse for desired flow rate will then be calculated and displayed.
